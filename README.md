1. For some reason, this spam bot would not work on my Mac, which is on macOS Monterey 12.1. It is probably due to default security / privacy settings. If they (the settings) allow, this code should work.
2. In Line 10 of spambot.py, you should include the path to texttospam.txt (your path will be different from my path, that's why I can't share my path :))
3. In texttospam.txt, you can change the text to anything you want.
